...since when did *I* have a repository? GITHUB PLEASE EXPLAIN I'M SO CONFUSED-

Anyways, hi! My name is Trey - [I go by Rare online.](https://hey.itzrare.cc) I sometimes post the source code to personal stuff I make here - the main thing I really want people to praise me for is [TNM-chan,](https://github.com/heyitzrare/tnm-chan) the main bot on this Discord server I made called [The Neptunia Mansion.](https://itzrare.cc/tnm)

Speaking of, if you're looking for more professional stuff, check out [TNM Dev Team's](https://github.com/TNMDevTeam) GitHub.
